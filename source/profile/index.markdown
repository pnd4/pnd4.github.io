{% img right /images/profile.jpg 217 290 %} My name is Kevin. Iâ€™m a computer engineering student at Cal State San Bernardino pursuant my Bachelor's Degree and part-time student at Riverside City College with hopes of acquiring some of Cisco's networking certifications. I've previously attended the University of California: Riverside and also received an Associate of Science degree in computer programming from Riverside City College. Some programming languages I am proficient in include: 32-bit assembly, Bash, C, C++, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Ruby, and PHP. In the realm of hardware, I'm currently getting started with hobbyist microcontrollers and hoping to create some things along the way. On any given day you can find me behind my desk immersed in the world of technology and on weekends at the paintball field.
