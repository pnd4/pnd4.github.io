{% img left https://pnd4.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/287_540274403664_5512_n.jpg 217 290 %} My name is Kevin. I’m a computer engineering student at Cal State San Bernardino. I previously attended the University of California: Riverside and also received an Associate of Science degree in computer programming from Riverside Community College. Some languages I am proficient in include: Microsoft ASM(32), Bash, C, C++, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Ruby, PHP. Hardware wise, I enjoy soldering projects, in particular building and repair of hifi-amplifiers. I have a fond interest in networking in’s and out’s, both ethernet and 802.11 fronts, as well as information security and forensics.
