{% img left /images/profile.jpg 217 290 %} My name is Kevin. Iâ€™m a computer engineering student at Cal State San Bernardino pursuant my Bachelor's Degree, also studying part time at Riverside Community College toward CCNA certification. I've previously attended the University of California: Riverside and also received an Associate of Science degree in computer programming from Riverside Community College. Some languages I am proficient in include: Microsoft ASM(32), Bash, C, C++, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Ruby, and PHP. In the realm of hardware, I'm currently getting started with microcontrollers and hoping to create some embedded systems as I learn more. On any given day you can find me behind my desk immersed in the world of technology and on weekends at the paintball field.
