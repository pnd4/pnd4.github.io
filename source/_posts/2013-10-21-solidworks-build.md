####Min Reqs (Win7x64)
    
    CPU     Intel or AMD with SSE2 support. 64-bit OS recommended.
    RAM     2GB+
    HDD     5GB+
    Video   Quadro/QuadroFX/FireGL/FirePro

##Notes regarding HW selection

+ [FirePro v3900](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814195112) was best bang for buck. Good Solidworks reviews.
+ 4GB of RAM will work, can always upgrade.
+ 3.5Ghz Dual core + Hyper-Threading ([i3-3220](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116775)/3240) should be plenty.

[Capinc Solidworks HW Tips](http://www.capinc.com/support/tips/solidworks-tech-tips-hardware)

+ Video Card: VERY important
+ Proc: Solidworks is optimized for multiple cores
+ RAM:
  Solidworks grabs 340mb on launch.
  4gb+ is only necessary for very large assemblies (over 10,000 parts)
+ HD: Generally, does not affect Solidworks performance
