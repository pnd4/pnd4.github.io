## Basics

### Starting a new repo

create project directory

    mkdir -p <folder>
    cd <folder>

create files or copy them from existing project.
    
    touch README.md
    
initialize barebone git files
    
    git init

prepare commit with annotations and files
    
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "<message>"

new project, so create remote origin, and master branch

    git remote add origin <url | git@github.com:pnd4/<project>.git"

publish files to the new git-repository

    git push -u origin master

[00:04:25] <Ferus> also thats why you git pull
[00:04:28] <Ferus> all the time
[00:04:29] <Ferus> lel
[00:04:33] <orik> xD
[00:04:57] * Ferus passes pnd4 an american spirit black
[00:04:59] <pnd4> hmm whats the diff between git pull and clone?
[00:05:00] <orik> well phoronix even has good things to say about mpv
[00:05:10] <orik> a pull just checks for changes and
[00:05:19] <Ferus> clone clones a new repo, pull pulls the new changes from master
[00:05:26] <orik> ^^
[00:05:27] <pnd4> oh ok.. thanks
[00:05:50] <orik> man I've been using git at work for the past three months and I swear I still don't fully understand it
[00:05:56] <Ferus> tl;dr if the repo doesnt exist locally, you clone from master, if it does exist locally, you pull from master
[00:06:19] <Ferus> orik: i've been using git for two years, i broke my repo 5 months ago and havent fixed it
[00:06:34] <Ferus> (i dont know how ;_;)
[00:07:41] <pnd4> ok so Ive cloned dwmstatus earlier, made changes. if I do a pull, does it undo my changes to match the current master?
[00:07:52] *** Joins: salam4ik (~salam4ik@89.106.233.158)
[00:08:10] * pnd4 copies directory and just tries it.. 'banzai!'
[00:08:21] <Ferus> no, it'll complain that you have un-stashed changed
[00:08:23] <Ferus> changes*
[00:08:39] <Ferus> so you want to do `git stash; git pull; git stash pop`
[00:09:05] <pnd4> stash, thats a new one too.. did I mention I'm quite new to git ? haha.
[00:09:17] <Ferus> (this is all i know how to do)
[00:09:27] <Ferus> besides add and rm, but thats kinda obvious
[00:09:44] <pnd4> thanks. I'll try and remember that if/when suckless puts out a new version
[00:10:49] <pnd4> I think having familiarity with git should help in the job search.. I mean, who wouldn't want a guy that's familiar with widely used version control systems?
[00:10:49] <Ferus> you can always google it
[00:11:46] <pnd4> that is true, but the tl;dr versions are always nice
[00:12:52] <pnd4> Halts: ebay has the hat I want for 25 (down from 35$) .. they're out of my size.. I share your pain.
[00:14:05] <pnd4> its like that scene in 'The Last Samurai' where they cut his hair
[00:15:40] <Halts> at least you can buy your hat.
[00:16:01] <pnd4> would you buy your jersey still if it was 120 ?
[00:16:59] <Ferus> > IP Location: Kingston / New York / United States
[00:17:08] <Ferus> bahaha this site is horrible, cant even geolocate
[00:18:22] <Halts> haha, not right now.
[00:18:28] <Halts> but I eventually would, yes.
[00:18:40] <Halts> I'd like to get it for
[00:18:50] <Halts> but, a bunch of cunts ruined that

[00:20:51] <n2o4> pnd4: Just checkout your features into it's own branch, for example git clone foobar, git checkout -b my-super-branch, make edits and commit, issue git checkout master to check into the master branch again.
