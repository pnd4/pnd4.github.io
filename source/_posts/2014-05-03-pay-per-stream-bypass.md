*After studying the source of a live webcast and the data that gets thrown around once the plugin is triggered to play, I managed to get a 10$ webcast for free. Honestly, I havent taken the time to try and understand all the jquery and javascript behind html5 media plugins but it turns out you can figure out the URI to pass to `mplayer` (or similar) using the contents of the SMIL file pretty easily.*

First, you're going to want to check out the source where the stream is embedded. Take note of the `vendorID` and `mediaID` parameters.

Next we want to examine the SMIL file which holds will tell us exactly where we can find our stream.

```
curl hxxp:||cdn.m0b1ler1der.c0m/m0b1ler1der/mobilestorefront/<vendorID>/media/file/<mediaID>/streams.smil
```

There should be a `content="http://yadayadayada.yup"` as well as one or more `src="/theStreamsYouWereLookingFor@rightHurr"` key-value pairs to help you put together a URI to give a go using your chosen media player. If your target is anything like mine, youâ€™ll have direct access to the stream, and saved yourself some money.

Here's my result to serve as an example or hint. More than likely it'll apply to all Mobilerider webcasts.

```
http://yadayadayada.yup/i/theStreamsYouWereLookingFor@rightHurr/master.m3u8
```

The parts of the string not supplied explicitly in the SMIL were taken from a previously valid URI from the same site.
