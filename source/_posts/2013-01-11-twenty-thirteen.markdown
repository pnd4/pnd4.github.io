Well, here it is.. my first post of 2013, located on my own domain from the awesome NameCheap.com, on a freshly set up Virtual Private Server by ChicagoVPS.net. So much thanks goes out to my Tita Fe, Tito Ram, Mom and Dad for funding this. Its been 2-weeks and already the experience has taught me so much more than simulating it on my local network.

As usual, I've been busy.. powering through the new year's weeks learning about stuff and trying it out. This week I gave my desktop a facelift: desktop's color scheme, revamped DWM and learned a little bit about Mercurial and Git version control systems along the way. Now my focus is on the website so expect to some changes you can see..

Happy New Years 'errbody !
