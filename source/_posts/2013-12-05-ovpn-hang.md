# Problem
CyberGhostVPN connection hangs on service start-up
Doesnt

# Investigation
#### DNS

**Dec 05 2013 - 04:38**

Seems CyberGhost uses a constantly renewing IP.. "US.openvpn.cyberghostvpn.com" resolved to at least 3 different IPs over the last 1-2 hrs. This caused the daemon to start up, fail because of something regarding the certificate, then repeatedly fail resolving until manually stopping the daemon.

The thread below talks about tuning openvpn to fix this.

>By default, on initial startup and restart, the --remote name is resolved
once. If the DNS resolve fails, OpenVPN will abort.
>
>If --resolve-retry is specified, the DNS resolve will be retried for n
seconds. After n seconds, if the DNS lookup has not been successful, OpenVPN
will abort. Recent versions of OpenVPN allow n to be "infinite".
>
>If you want to disable the DNS re-resolve on restart, you can use
--persist-remote-ip. This will "recycle" the previously used --remote IP
address without doing a new DNS lookup.
