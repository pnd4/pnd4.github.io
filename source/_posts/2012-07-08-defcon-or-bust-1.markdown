I've decided that this summer I'd like to attend Def Con 20. After watching talks from previous Def Cons and other various events over the years on-line its finally time for me to get out and physically be there. I've been trying to head out to some 'talks' out here in the bay area too, but since Def Con is coming right up, and I still live on the right coast, why not. Its a great opportunity to see what's new in the world of technology first hand and meet the actual people developing it all in one place.

If you even consider knowing me, even just a little bit, you know that I'm a huge fan of this kind of stuff, and have been since primary school. I've always tried to make myself available to help solve problems and willing to guide friends and family that have also shown interest in the area with all I can offer. Its a learning experience, every time. Like they say, "Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." Which is why I urge anyone reading this to come to with, simply because its pretty much impossible to walk out of one of these places and not be inspired.. not to mention its in Vegas :)

Unfortunately, at this point in my life there's a lot of free time to be spent, and life is short. Conversely, money is short-coming and school is annually getting more expensive. Education and opportunities we can all agree are valuable. Getting me to Def Con 20 isn't going to be easy, but all I have is time,`a willing mind, and a drive to be there. With a little help I'm sure I'll be hacking away with the best of them out in Las Vegas at the end of the month.
